# Capsule

Capsule is a Jetpack Compose library that creates **G2 continuous** rounded rectangles.

## Installation

[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.github.kyant0/capsule)](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.github.kyant0/capsule)

In build.gradle.kts, add

```kotlin
implementation("io.github.kyant0:capsule:<version>")
```

## Usages

Replace the `RoundedCornerShape` with `ContinuousRoundedRectangle` or `ContinuousCapsule`:

```kotlin
// create a basic rounded corner shape
ContinuousRoundedRectangle(16.dp)

// create a capsule shape
ContinuousCapsule
```

Custom continuity:

```kotlin
val g1 = G1Continuity // no corner smoothness
val g2 = G2Continuity(
    profile = G2ContinuityProfile.RoundedRectangle.copy(
        extendedFraction = 0.5,
        arcFraction = 0.5,
        bezierCurvatureScale = 1.1,
        arcCurvatureScale = 1.1
    ),
    capsuleProfile = G2ContinuityProfile.Capsule.copy(
        extendedFraction = 0.5,
        arcFraction = 0.25
    )
)

// create shapes with custom continuity
ContinuousRoundedRectangle(16.dp, continuity = g2)
ContinuousCapsule(continuity = g2)
```

The following parameters are supported by `G2ContinuityProfile`:

- **extended fraction:** the transition length between original corner and line, relative to the corner radius
- **arc fraction:** the ratio of the arc to the corner
- **Bezier curvature scale**: the multiplier of the end curvature of the Bezier curve
- **arc curvature scale**: the multiplier of the arc curvature

**Note:** It guarantees G1 continuity at least. Only if the Bezier curvature scale equals the arc curvature scale,
it will have exact G2 continuity.

## Tips

### Performance

Drawing cubic BÃ©zier curves on Android performs poorly. However, the Capsule library uses a very efficient method to
calculate the control points, achieving optimal theoretical performance.

When the shape area is large (almost fullscreen) and the corner radius is constantly changing, performance may decrease.
Use `animatedShape.copy(continuity = G1Continuity)` to temporarily disable corner smoothing during the
animation.
